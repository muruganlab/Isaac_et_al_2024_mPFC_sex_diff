This repository (*currently being updated) contains codes and sample data to recreate part of figure 2 and Supplementary figure 7 of the paper. Naviagte to the `codes` folder and run the codes - `suppFig7.m` or `figure2.m` as needed. Associated functions to run the code are saved in `codes\functions\` folder. All figures created are saved as .pdf and .pngs in the `figures` folder. The `data` folder contains both the `male` and `female` mice data files for the `full_Water_Access` condition (find more details in the paper). Each .mat file contains the preprocessed calcium traces (&#916;F/F) along with timestamps of behavioral events of interest, such as choice pokes, and reward consumption that are used to create the figures saved in the codes above.
